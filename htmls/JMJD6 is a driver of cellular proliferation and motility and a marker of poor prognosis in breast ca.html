        <title>JMJD6 is a driver of cellular proliferation and motility and a marker of poor prognosis in breast cancer | Breast Cancer Research | Full Text</title>

        

    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="We developed an analytic strategy that correlates gene expression and clinical outcomes as a means to identify novel candidate oncogenes operative in breast cancer. This analysis, followed by functional characterization, resulted in the identification of Jumonji Domain Containing 6 (JMJD6) protein as a novel driver of oncogenic properties in breast cancer. Through microarray informatics, Cox proportional hazards regression was used to analyze the correlation between gene expression and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) of patients in 14 independent breast cancer cohorts. JMJD6 emerged as a top candidate gene robustly associated with poor patient survival. Immunohistochemistry, siRNA-mediated silencing, and forced overexpression of JMJD6 in cell-based assays elucidated molecular mechanisms of JMJD6 action in breast cancer progression and shed light on the clinical breast cancer subtypes relevant to JMJD6 action. 
JMJD6 was expressed at highest levels in tumors associated with worse outcomes, including ER- and basal-like, Claudin-low, Her2-enriched, and ER+ Luminal B tumors. High nuclear JMJD6 protein was associated with ER negativity, advanced grade, and poor differentiation in tissue microarrays. Separation of ER+/LN- patients that received endocrine monotherapy indicated that JMJD6 is predictive of poor outcome in treatment-specific subgroups. In breast cancer cell lines, loss of JMJD6 consistently resulted in suppressed proliferation but not apoptosis, whereas forced stable overexpression increased growth. In addition, knockdown of JMJD6 in invasive cell lines, such as MDA-MB231, decreased motility and invasion, whereas overexpression in MCF-7 cells slightly promoted motility but did not confer invasive growth. Microarray analysis showed that the most significant transcriptional changes occurred in cell-proliferation genes and genes of the TGF-&#946; tumor-suppressor pathway. High proliferation was characterized by constitutively high cyclin E protein levels. The inverse relation of JMJD6 expression with TGF-&#946;

                   could be extrapolated to the breast cancer cohorts, suggesting that JMJD6 may affect similar pathways in primary breast cancer.

        <meta property="og:description" content="Introduction We developed an analytic strategy that correlates gene expression and clinical outcomes as a means to identify novel candidate oncogenes operative in breast cancer. This analysis, followed by functional characterization, resulted in the identification of Jumonji Domain Containing 6 (JMJD6) protein as a novel driver of oncogenic properties in breast cancer. Methods Through microarray informatics, Cox proportional hazards regression was used to analyze the correlation between gene expression and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) of patients in 14 independent breast cancer cohorts. JMJD6 emerged as a top candidate gene robustly associated with poor patient survival. Immunohistochemistry, siRNA-mediated silencing, and forced overexpression of JMJD6 in cell-based assays elucidated molecular mechanisms of JMJD6 action in breast cancer progression and shed light on the clinical breast cancer subtypes relevant to JMJD6 action. Results JMJD6 was expressed at highest levels in tumors associated with worse outcomes, including ER- and basal-like, Claudin-low, Her2-enriched, and ER+ Luminal B tumors. High nuclear JMJD6 protein was associated with ER negativity, advanced grade, and poor differentiation in tissue microarrays. Separation of ER+/LN- patients that received endocrine monotherapy indicated that JMJD6 is predictive of poor outcome in treatment-specific subgroups. In breast cancer cell lines, loss of JMJD6 consistently resulted in suppressed proliferation but not apoptosis, whereas forced stable overexpression increased growth. In addition, knockdown of JMJD6 in invasive cell lines, such as MDA-MB231, decreased motility and invasion, whereas overexpression in MCF-7 cells slightly promoted motility but did not confer invasive growth. Microarray analysis showed that the most significant transcriptional changes occurred in cell-proliferation genes and genes of the TGF-β tumor-suppressor pathway. High proliferation was characterized by constitutively high cyclin E protein levels. The inverse relation of JMJD6 expression with TGF-β 2 could be extrapolated to the breast cancer cohorts, suggesting that JMJD6 may affect similar pathways in primary breast cancer. Conclusions JMJD6 is a novel biomarker of tumor aggressiveness with functional implications in breast cancer growth and migration.">

JMJD6 emerged as a top candidate gene robustly associated with poor patient survival. Immunohistochemistry, siRNA-mediated silencing, and forced overexpression of JMJD6 in cell-based assays elucidated molecular mechanisms of JMJD6 action in breast cancer progression and shed light on the clinical breast cancer subtypes relevant to JMJD6 action. \nJMJD6 was expressed at highest levels in tumors associated with worse outcomes, including ER- and basal-like, Claudin-low, Her2-enriched, and ER+ Luminal B tumors. High nuclear JMJD6 protein was associated with ER negativity, advanced grade, and poor differentiation in tissue microarrays. Separation of ER+/LN- patients that received endocrine monotherapy indicated that JMJD6 is predictive of poor outcome in treatment-specific subgroups. In breast cancer cell lines, loss of JMJD6 consistently resulted in suppressed proliferation but not apoptosis, whereas forced stable overexpression increased growth. In addition, knockdown of JMJD6 in invasive cell lines, such as MDA-MB231, decreased motility and invasion, whereas overexpression in MCF-7 cells slightly promoted motility but did not confer invasive growth. Microarray analysis showed that the most significant transcriptional changes occurred in cell-proliferation genes and genes of the TGF-β tumor-suppressor pathway. High proliferation was characterized by constitutively high cyclin E protein levels. The inverse relation of JMJD6 expression with TGF-β\n\n                    2\n                   could be extrapolated to the breast cancer cohorts, suggesting that JMJD6 may affect similar pathways in primary breast cancer. \nJMJD6 is a novel biomarker of tumor aggressiveness with functional implications in breast cancer growth and migration.","datePublished":"2012-05-23","dateModified":"2012-05-23","pageStart":"1","pageEnd":"16","sameAs":"https://doi.org/10.1186/bcr3200","keywords":"Cancer Research,Oncology,Surgical Oncology","image":"https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fbcr3200/MediaObjects/13058_2011_3001_Fig1_HTML.jpg","isPartOf":{"name":"Breast Cancer Research","issn":["1465-542X"],"volumeNumber":"14","@type":["Periodical","PublicationVolume"]},"publisher":{"name":"BioMed Central","logo":{"url":"https://www.springernature.com/app-sn/public/images/logo-springernature.png","@type":"ImageObject"},"@type":"Organization"},"author":[{"name":"Lee, Yi Fang","affiliation":[{"name":"Genome Institute of Singapore","address":{"name":"Department of Cancer Biology and Pharmacology, Genome Institute of Singapore, Kragujevac, Singapore","@type":"PostalAddress"},"@type":"Organization"}],"@type":"Person"},{"name":"Miller, Lance David","affiliation":[{"name":"Wake Forest University School of Medicine","address":{"name":"Department of Cancer Biology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, USA","@type":"PostalAddress"},"@type":"Organization"}],"@type":"Person"},{"name":"Chan, Xiu Bin","affiliation":[{"name":"Genome Institute of Singapore","address":{"name":"Department of Cancer Biology and Pharmacology, Genome Institute of Singapore, Kragujevac, Singapore","@type":"PostalAddress"},"@type":"Organization"}],"@type":"Person"},{"name":"Black, Michael A","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Otago","address":{"name":"Department of Biochemistry, Otago School of Medical Sciences, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand","@type":"PostalAddress"},"@type":"Organization"}],"@type":"Person"},{"name":"Pang, Brendan","affiliation":[{"name":"National University Health System and National University of Singapore","address":{"name":"Department of Pathology, National University Health System and National University of Singapore, Kragujevac, Singapore","@type":"PostalAddress"},"@type":"Organization"}],"@type":"Person"},{"name":"Ong, Chee Wee","affiliation":[{"name":"National University Health System and National University of Singapore","address":{"name":"Department of Pathology, National University Health System and National University of Singapore, Kragujevac, Singapore","@type":"PostalAddress"},"@type":"Organization"}],"@type":"Person"},{"name":"Salto-Tellez, Manuel","affiliation":[{"name":"Queen’s University Belfast","address":{"name":"Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen’s University Belfast, Belfast, UK","@type":"PostalAddress"},"@type":"Organization"},{"name":"Cancer Science Institute, National University of Singapore","address":{"name":"Cancer Science Institute, National University of Singapore, Kragujevac, Singapore","@type":"PostalAddress"},"@type":"Organization"}],"@type":"Person"},{"name":"Liu, Edison T","affiliation":[{"name":"Genome Institute of Singapore","address":{"name":"Department of Cancer Biology and Pharmacology, Genome Institute of Singapore, Kragujevac, Singapore","@type":"PostalAddress"},"@type":"Organization"},{"name":"The Jackson Laboratory","address":{"name":"The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, USA","@type":"PostalAddress"},"@type":"Organization"}],"@type":"Person"},{"name":"Desai, Kartiki V","affiliation":[{"name":"National Institute of Biomedical Genomics","address":{"name":"National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani, India","@type":"PostalAddress"},"@type":"Organization"}],"email":"kd1@nibmg.ac.in","@type":"Person"}],"@type":"ScholarlyArticle"},"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"WebPage"}</script>

<i>JMJD6</i> was expressed at highest levels in tumors associated with worse outcomes, including ER- and basal-like, Claudin-low, Her2-enriched, and ER<sup>+</sup> Luminal B tumors. High nuclear JMJD6 protein was associated with ER negativity, advanced grade, and poor differentiation in tissue microarrays. Separation of ER<sup>+</sup>/LN<sup>-</sup> patients that received endocrine monotherapy indicated that <i>JMJD6</i> is predictive of poor outcome in treatment-specific subgroups. In breast cancer cell lines, loss of <i>JMJD6</i> consistently resulted in suppressed proliferation but not apoptosis, whereas forced stable overexpression increased growth. In addition, knockdown of <i>JMJD6</i> in invasive cell lines, such as MDA-MB231, decreased motility and invasion, whereas overexpression in MCF-7 cells slightly promoted motility but did not confer invasive growth. Microarray analysis showed that the most significant transcriptional changes occurred in cell-proliferation genes and genes of the TGF-β tumor-suppressor pathway. High proliferation was characterized by constitutively high cyclin E protein levels. The inverse relation of <i>JMJD6</i> expression with <i>TGF-β</i>

We previously used gene-expression profiles of breast tumors to identify extracellular/secretory proteins and cell surface-receptor genes whose high expression levels associate with poor clinical end points. For example, we recently identified serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 1 (<i>SPINK1</i>) as an important therapeutic target in breast cancer by using a combined genotype and phenotype screening approach. We found that inhibition of SPINK1 by neutralizing antibodies curtailed multiple aggressive properties, including cell survival, invasiveness, and chemoresistance [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Soon WWML, Black MA, Dalmasso C, Chan XB, Pang B, Ong CW, Salto-Tellez M, Desai K, Liu ET: Combined genomic and phenotype screening reveals secretory factor SPINK1 as an invasion and survival factor associated with patient prognosis in breast cancer.&#xA;EMBO Mol Med 2011, 3:451–464." href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#ref-CR1_3001" id="ref-link-section-d167701133e877">1</a>].

We report herein that perturbation of <i>JMJD6</i> expression modulates cell proliferation and cell scattering and motility: phenotypes associated with cancer metastasis. Furthermore, our findings suggest that these cellular phenotypes may be elicited by JMJD6-mediated suppression of transforming growth factor-beta 2 (TGF-β2) and/or activation of proteins that potentiate cell division in a cell type-specific manner. These <i>in vitro</i> mechanistic findings are consistent with the clinical observations that <i>JMJD6</i> expression correlates positively with proliferation index and high histologic grade but inversely with <i>TGF-β2</i> expression. Together, these data implicate JMJD6 function in breast tumor progression and suggest a diagnostic role for JMJD6 in predicting patient outcomes.</p></div></div></section><section data-title="Materials and methods"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec2_3001-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec2_3001">Materials and methods</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec2_3001-content"><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec3_3001">Breast cancer clinical datasets</h3><p>Tumor-expression profiles were obtained with approval from and in accordance with the policies of the institutional review boards of the respective institutions.

We examined the survival outcome of <i>JMJD6</i> high- and low-expresser groups, determined by median separation across the Super Cohort, within each subtype.

We studied JMJD6 expression in a panel of five breast cancer cell lines (see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#MOESM5">5</a>, Figure S3A). With the exception of MCF-7 cells, JMJD6 was highly expressed in breast cancer cell lines. We used a lentiviral-based cloning system to infect MCF-7 cells with V5-tagged JMJD6 and achieved stable expression of JMJD6 (MCF-7 J1-OE). As a pool, these cells showed increased proliferation (see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#MOESM6">6</a>, Figure S4), and this was confirmed in individual clones, J1-C2, J1-C3, and J1-C7 (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#Fig4">4A</a>). Over a period of 5 days, MCF-7-J1-OE clones (J1-C2, J1-C3, and J1-C7) showed higher proliferation as early as day 2 and continued to grow faster as compared with empty vector control cells (Vec) (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#Fig4">4A</a>). Next we silenced <i>JMJD6</i> expression in all five cell lines by using a panel of siRNAs and assayed their proliferation. We achieved 80% to 100% silencing of JMJD6 protein, depending on the basal, endogenous expression level of JMJD6 (see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#MOESM5">5</a>, Figure S3A). Four different siRNAs resulted in profound loss of proliferation in MCF-7 and MDA MB231 cells (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#Fig4">4B</a> and <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#Fig4">4C</a>). This decrease was not due to increased apoptosis, because higher levels of cleaved PARP were not evident in the JMJD6 knockdown cells (see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#MOESM5">5</a>, Figure S3B).

Together, these results suggest that high levels of JMJD6 lead to increased cell proliferation. To determine whether further induction of JMJD6 in cells with intrinsically higher JMJD6 levels shows an additive increase in cell proliferation, we generated MB231-J1-OE, T47D-J1-OE, and CAMA-J1-OE cells (see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#MOESM7">7</a>, Figure S5).

<h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec24_3001">JMJD6 enhances scattering and motility</h3><p>Our <i>in silico</i> analysis and IHC data showed that <i>JMJD6</i> is associated with aggressive advanced disease. We next studied whether this protein could influence cell motility and invasion by using cell-scatter, wound-healing, and Boyden chamber assays. The motility and invasion assays were performed within 24 hours to minimize secondary effects of cell proliferation. For the scattering phenotype, we used a counting system previously described by Shtutman <i>et al.</i> [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 19" title="Shtutman M, Levina E, Ohouo P, Baig M, Roninson IB: Cell adhesion molecule L1 disrupts E-cadherin-containing adherens junctions and increases scattering and motility of MCF7 breast carcinoma cells.&#xA;Cancer Res 2006, 66:11370–11380." href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#ref-CR19_3001" id="ref-link-section-d167701133e2034">19</a>] to evaluate the degree of scattering (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#Fig5">5A</a>). All three MCF-7-J1-OE clones showed an increase in scattering as compared with Vec cells. An increase in scattering often implies a gain in motility or epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT). Therefore, we assayed loss of E-cadherin and gain in vimentin as markers for EMT. Immunoblots showed that MCF-7J1-OE clones maintained E-cad expression (see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#MOESM8">8</a>, Figure S6), suggesting that the scattering is probably encouraged by motility. Indeed, in a wound-healing assay, MCF-7-J1-OE clones closed the wound much faster than did Vec cells (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#Fig5">5B</a>). Because increased cell number due to increased proliferation can mislead interpretation of wound-healing data; we performed these assays in the presence of mitomycin C, an inhibitor of cell division. Despite a gain in motility, we were unable to demonstrate an increase in invasive behavior in MCF-7-J1-OE cells (data not shown). However, in MDA-MB231, a highly motile and invasive cell line, knockdown of JMJD6 significantly attenuated both properties (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#Fig5">5C</a>). To negate the contribution of decreased proliferation in this assay, we normalized these results to the proliferation changes observed on day 2 (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#Fig5">5C</a>). However, the cells maintained loss in motility and invasion, showing that this property was independent of proliferation defects. Together, these data imply that JMJD6 is not a "driver" of cell invasion but may augment cell movement.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-5" data-title="Figure 5"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig5" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Figure 5</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200/figures/5" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fbcr3200/MediaObjects/13058_2011_3001_Fig5_HTML.jpg?as=webp"><img aria-describedby="Fig5" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fbcr3200/MediaObjects/13058_2011_3001_Fig5_HTML.jpg" alt="figure 5" loading="lazy"></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-5-desc"><p>

<i>JMJD6</i> expression inversely correlates with <i>TGF-β2</i>
</h3><p>To determine the pathways involved in JMJD6-induced proliferation, we performed microarray analysis by using the MCF-7-J1-OE clones and <i>JMJD6</i> siRNA-treated MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells. We selected 2,216 overlapping probe sets that were commonly and appropriately regulated in all three settings: MCF-7-J1-OE, MCF-7 siRNA, and MDA-MB231 siRNA (see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#MOESM9">9</a>, Table S3). Clusters of genes regulated in the opposite directions in JMJD6 overexpression and JMJD6 knockdown were denoted JMJD6-induced and JMJD6-repressed gene sets, respectively (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#Fig6">6</a>).

In accordance with our cell-based assays, in the JMJD6-induced gene set, the top enriched functions were cell-cycle and DNA replication, followed by cellular assembly and cellular movement (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#Fig6">6</a>; see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#MOESM10">10</a>, Table S4).

Loss of JMJD6 increased <i>TGF-β1</i> and <i>TGF-β2</i> expression, whereas <i>TGF-β3</i> was unaffected in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#Fig7">7A</a> and <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#Fig7">7B</a>).

In contrast, in MCF-7-J1-OE cells, a significant decrease in <i>TGF-β2</i> mRNA and protein expression was observed (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#Fig7">7D</a> and <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#Fig7">7E</a>). At the protein level, we failed to detect changes in TGF-β1 and TGF-β3, although both isoforms were expressed (data not shown).

Similarly, an increase in SMAD2 and SMAD3 phosphorylation with <i>JMJD6</i> siRNA treatment was seen in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB231, as opposed to a decrease observed in the MCF-7 J1 OE clones (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#Fig8">8</a>).

<p>Last, treatment of MCF-7 J1-OE cells with recombinant TGF-β2 repressed proliferation in both Vec and J1-OE cells, suggesting that MCF-7 retained sensitivity to TGF-β2-mediated growth regulation despite increased JMJD6 levels (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#Fig9">9C</a>). Therefore, JMJD6 did not confer unresponsiveness to this growth factor, but probably mediated its effect via repression of gene expression. Together these data suggest that in MCF-7 cells, JMJD6 mediates cell-cycle regulation, in part by suppressing <i>TGF-β2</i>.</p><p>Secretion of TGF-β2 cannot explain the growth arrest in <i>JMJD6</i> siRNA-treated MDA MB 231 cells. Scanning of microarray data revealed that JMJD6 changed the levels of G<sub>1</sub> cyclins: <i>cyclins E1, E2</i>, and <i>D</i> at the RNA level. In MDA MB 231 cells, we confirmed a loss in cyclin E2 protein expression but not E1 or cyclin D in JMJD6 siRNA-containing cells (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#Fig10">10</a>).

Together these data indicate that in both cells, JMJD6 mediated suppression of <i>TGF-β2</i>. In MCF-7 cells, the proliferation is controlled by both TGF-β2 and cyclin E regulation, but in MDA 231 cells, the cyclin E regulation may contribute to this phenotype, rather than TGF-β2 signaling. Other pathways that operate in MDA-MB 231 cells must be explored further.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-10" data-title="Figure 10"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig10" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Figure 10</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200/figures/10" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fbcr3200/MediaObjects/13058_2011_3001_Fig10_HTML.jpg?as=webp"><img aria-describedby="Fig10" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fbcr3200/MediaObjects/13058_2011_3001_Fig10_HTML.jpg" alt="figure 10" loading="lazy"></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-10-desc"><p>

Consistent with its potential as a marker of breast cancer aggressiveness, <i>JMJD6</i> was expressed at highest levels in ER<sup>-</sup>, basal, claudin-low, <i>HER2</i>-enriched, and Luminal B tumor subtypes, which are known to be clinically associated with poor patient outcomes. Most important, in the less-aggressive ER<sup>+</sup> subtypes (for example, Luminal A), high levels of <i>JMJD6</i> could predict poor outcome and possibly resistance to tamoxifen monotherapy. Protein analysis by using tissue microarray confirmed that high <i>JMJD6</i> expression is consistently associated with ER<sup>-</sup> disease, higher grade, and advanced stage. These data demonstrate for the first time that JMJD6 is a relevant prognostic biomarker in breast cancer.</p><p>By phenotypic and functional analysis, we found that <i>JMJD6</i> induced an increase in cell scattering and increased the rate of wound closure in MCF-7 cells, but did not confer an invasive phenotype. In invasive cells like MDA-MB231 and BT-549 with high expression of <i>JMJD6</i>, siRNA-mediated suppression led to loss of both motility and invasiveness properties. Because forced <i>JMJD6</i> expression did not confer invasiveness, this apparent loss of invasiveness most likely follows a loss in motility. Nonetheless, JMJD6 may have a critical role in epithelial cell movement, and we showed that this property is not restricted to endothelial cells [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 7" title="Boeckel J-N, Guarani V, Koyanagi M, Roexe T, Lengeling A, Schermuly RT, Gellert P, Braun T, Zeiher A, Dimmeler S: Jumonji domain-containing protein 6 (Jmjd6) is required for angiogenic sprouting and regulates splicing of VEGF-receptor 1.&#xA;Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2011, 108:3276–3281." href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#ref-CR7_3001" id="ref-link-section-d167701133e2586">7</a>]. However, this appears to be a minor function of JMJD6, because its exogenous expression did not induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (that is, we did not observe a loss or gain in E-cadherin or vimentin expression, respectively, in MCF-7 J1-OE cells).</p><p>The most prominent effect of JMJD6 perturbation was on cell proliferation. SiRNA-mediated attenuation of JMJD6 in multiple breast cancer cells led to a decrease in cell proliferation without activation of cellular apoptosis, whereas forced expression in MCF-7 resulted in a massive increase in cell proliferation. This finding is consistent with the observation that JMJD6-knockout mice are small and show growth retardation [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 3" title="Bose J, Gruber A, Helming L, Schiebe S, Wegener I, Hafner M, Beales M, Kontgen F, Lengeling A: The phosphatidylserine receptor has essential functions during embryogenesis but not in apoptotic cell removal.&#xA;J Biol 2004, 3:15." href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#ref-CR3_3001" id="ref-link-section-d167701133e2592">3</a>]. The role of JMJD6 in proliferation is further substantiated by our microarray analysis, which revealed that modulation of JMJD6 expression significantly affected the expression levels of a number of cell cycle-associated genes (see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#MOESM10">10</a>, Table S4).

We validated the inverse relation between <i>JMJD6</i> and <i>TGF-β2</i> at both RNA and protein levels in these cellular systems. We extended this observation to clinical samples and observed an inverse correlation between <i>JMJD6</i> and <i>TGF-β2</i> in our breast cancer cohorts.

In both MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 transfected with <i>JMJD6</i> siRNA, we observed suppression of cyclin E expression, and an increase in cyclin E was evident when <i>JMJD6</i> was overexpressed in MCF-7 cells. Therefore, in both cell lines, JMJD6 may exert a proliferative effect through a direct increase in cyclin E protein levels, or this increase may be a consequence of JMJD6-mediated suppression of TGF-β2. In both MCF-7 and MDA-MB231, the downstream effectors, Smads, were phosphorylated on JMJD6 siRNA-mediated secretion of TGF-β2. Specifically, in MCF-7, inhibition of TGF-β activity by using a TGF-β type I receptor (Alk5) inhibitor resulted in the loss of Smad phosphorylation, rescue of arrested cells, and continuation of proliferation (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#Fig9">9</a>). The Alk5 inhibitor did not reverse cell-cycle arrest in MDA-MB 231 cells because they are refractory to the antiproliferative effect of TGF-β, suggesting that the JMJD6-cyclin E axis may function independent of TGF-β2 in these cells. Intriguingly, cyclin E is associated with poor prognosis, chromosomal instability, and trastuzumab resistance, suggesting that the long-term dysregulation of cell-cycle mediators by JMJD6 may affect more than just proliferation [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 36" title="Keyomarsi K, Tucker SL, Buchholz TA, Callister M, Ding Y, Hortobagyi GN, Bedrosian I, Knickerbocker C, Toyofuku W, Lowe M, Herliczek TW, Bacus SS: Cyclin E and survival in patients with breast cancer.&#xA;N Engl J Med 2002, 347:1566–1575." href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#ref-CR36_3001" id="ref-link-section-d167701133e2649">36</a>–<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 38" title="Scaltriti M, Eichhorn PJ, Cortés J, Prudkin L, Aura C, Jiménez J, Chandarlapaty S, Serra V, Prat A, Ibrahim YH, Guzmán M, Gili M, Rodríguez O, Rodríguez S, Pérez J, Green SR, Mai S, Rosen N, Hudis C, Baselga J: Cyclin E amplification/overexpression is a mechanism of trastuzumab resistance in HER2+ breast cancer patients.&#xA;Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2011, 108:3761–3766." href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3200#ref-CR38_3001" id="ref-link-section-d167701133e2652">38</a>].</p><p>Our initial microarray analysis selected genes that were commonly regulated by JMJD6 in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 cells.

JMJD6 has ability to promote cancer cell proliferation and motility, which in turn may augment cancer virulence <i>in vivo</i>. In the clinic, JMJD6 associates with advanced grade, an aggressive phenotype, and serves as a marker of poor prognosis in breast cancer. We propose that JMJD6 staining (with IHC) may serve a dual purpose in the clinic: to predict poor outcome in patients, particularly in the ER<sup>+</sup> subtype, and to identify a patient subgroup wherein specific inhibitors of JMJD6 may facilitate the pathologic downstaging of tumors in the neoadjuvant setting.</p></div></div></section>
