  <meta name="description" content="Background Cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) have been proven suitable for stem cell therapy after myocardial infarction, especially c-kit(+)CPCs. CPCs marker c-kit and its ligand, the stem cell factor (SCF), are linked as c-kit/SCF axis, which is associated with the functions of proliferation and differentiation. In our previous study, we found that stromal cell-derived factor-1&alpha; (SDF-1&alpha;) could enhance the expression of c-kit. However, the mechanism is unknown.  Methods and Results CPCs were isolated from adult mouse hearts, c-kit(+) and c-kit(&minus;) CPCs were separated by magnetic beads. The cells were cultured with SDF-1&alpha; and CXCR4-selective antagonist AMD3100, and c-kit expression was measured by qPCR and Western blotting. Results showed that SDF-1&alpha; could enhance c-kit expression of c-kit(+)CPCs, made c-kit(&minus;)CPCs expressing c-kit, and AMD3100 could inhibit the function of SDF-1&alpha;. After the intervention of SDF-1&alpha; and AMD3100, proliferation and migration of CPCs were measured by CCK-8 and transwell assay. Results showed that SDF-1&alpha; could enhance the proliferation and migration of both c-kit(+) and c-kit(&minus;) CPCs, and AMD3100 could inhibit these functions. DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) mRNA were measured by qPCR, DNMT activity was measured using the DNMT activity assay kit, and DNA methylation was analyzed using Sequenom's MassARRAY platform, after the CPCs were cultured with SDF-1&alpha;. The results showed that SDF-1&alpha; stimulation inhibited the expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3&beta;, which are critical for the maintenance of regional DNA methylation. Global DNMT activity was also inhibited by SDF-1&alpha;. Lastly, SDF-1&alpha; treatment led to significant demethylation in both c-kit(+) and c-kit(&minus;) CPCs.  Conclusions SDF-1&alpha; combined with CXCR4 could up-regulate c-kit expression of c-kit(+)CPCs and make c-kit(&minus;)CPCs expressing c-kit, which result in the CPCs proliferation and migration ability improvement, through the inhibition of DNMT1 and DNMT3&beta; expression and global DNMT activity, as well as the subsequent demethylation of the c-kit gene." />

In addition, concerns were raised regarding substantial overlap with the work reported in both articles [<a href="#pone.0247094.ref001" class="ref-tip">1</a>, <a href="#pone.0247094.ref002" class="ref-tip">2</a>]. Specifically,</p>


<ul xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" class="bulleted">

<li>The panels in Fig 1A and 1B [<a href="#pone.0247094.ref001" class="ref-tip">1</a>] appear similar to the panels in Fig 1B and 1C [<a href="#pone.0247094.ref002" class="ref-tip">2</a>] respectively.</li>

<li>The c-kit(+)CPCs control panel in Fig 3C [<a href="#pone.0247094.ref001" class="ref-tip">1</a>] partially overlaps with the c-kit(+)CPCs SDF-1+AMD3100 panel in Fig 3C [<a href="#pone.0247094.ref001" class="ref-tip">1</a>], the normal panel of Fig 3C [<a href="#pone.0247094.ref002" class="ref-tip">2</a>], and the SDF-1+AMD3100 panel of Fig 3C [<a href="#pone.0247094.ref002" class="ref-tip">2</a>].</li>

<li>There is overlap in the experimental design, results and analyses between the <em>PLOS ONE</em> article [<a href="#pone.0247094.ref001" class="ref-tip">1</a>] and those reported in [<a href="#pone.0247094.ref002" class="ref-tip">2</a>].

</ul><a xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="body1.p2" name="body1.p2" class="link-target"></a><p xmlns:plos="http://plos.org">The authors have provided underlying data for the results presented in Fig 3 and indicated that the two Fig 3C panels [<a href="#pone.0247094.ref001" class="ref-tip">1</a>] appear similar because the wrong image was included in the figure. The authors indicate that the experimental data in this article [<a href="#pone.0247094.ref001" class="ref-tip">1</a>] appears similar to the data presented in [<a href="#pone.0247094.ref002" class="ref-tip">2</a>] because several experiments were repeated, and they state that experimental data was not reused for both articles. However, the authors’ statement that the experimental data was not reused does not sufficiently address concerns regarding the similarity between multiple panels presented in these articles.</p>

At the time of retraction, the article [<a href="#pone.0247094.ref001" class="ref-tip">1</a>] was republished to note this exclusion in the Figs 1 and 3 legends and the article’s copyright statement.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<a id="article1.front1.article-meta1.abstract1.sec1.p1" name="article1.front1.article-meta1.abstract1.sec1.p1" class="link-target"></a><p>Cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) have been proven suitable for stem cell therapy after myocardial infarction, especially c-kit(+)CPCs. CPCs marker c-kit and its ligand, the stem cell factor (SCF), are linked as c-kit/SCF axis, which is associated with the functions of proliferation and differentiation. In our previous study, we found that stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) could enhance the expression of c-kit. However, the mechanism is unknown.</p>
</div>

<div id="section2" class="section toc-section"><a id="" name="" class="link-target" title="Methods and Results"></a>
<h3>Methods and Results</h3>
<a id="article1.front1.article-meta1.abstract1.sec2.p1" name="article1.front1.article-meta1.abstract1.sec2.p1" class="link-target"></a><p>CPCs were isolated from adult mouse hearts, c-kit(+) and c-kit(−) CPCs were separated by magnetic beads. The cells were cultured with SDF-1α and CXCR4-selective antagonist AMD3100, and c-kit expression was measured by qPCR and Western blotting. Results showed that SDF-1α could enhance c-kit expression of c-kit(+)CPCs, made c-kit(−)CPCs expressing c-kit, and AMD3100 could inhibit the function of SDF-1α. After the intervention of SDF-1α and AMD3100, proliferation and migration of CPCs were measured by CCK-8 and transwell assay. Results showed that SDF-1α could enhance the proliferation and migration of both c-kit(+) and c-kit(−) CPCs, and AMD3100 could inhibit these functions. DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) mRNA were measured by qPCR, DNMT activity was measured using the DNMT activity assay kit, and DNA methylation was analyzed using Sequenom's MassARRAY platform, after the CPCs were cultured with SDF-1α. The results showed that SDF-1α stimulation inhibited the expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3β, which are critical for the maintenance of regional DNA methylation. Global DNMT activity was also inhibited by SDF-1α. Lastly, SDF-1α treatment led to significant demethylation in both c-kit(+) and c-kit(−) CPCs.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<a id="article1.front1.article-meta1.abstract1.sec3.p1" name="article1.front1.article-meta1.abstract1.sec3.p1" class="link-target"></a><p>SDF-1α combined with CXCR4 could up-regulate c-kit expression of c-kit(+)CPCs and make c-kit(−)CPCs expressing c-kit, which result in the CPCs proliferation and migration ability improvement, through the inhibition of DNMT1 and DNMT3β expression and global DNMT activity, as well as the subsequent demethylation of the c-kit gene.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section1" class="section toc-section"><a id="s1" name="s1" data-toc="s1" class="link-target" title="Introduction"></a><h2>Introduction</h2><a id="article1.body1.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec1.p1" class="link-target"></a><p>Ischemic heart disease remain the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide, and stem cell therapy may regenerate cardiac tissue directly by inducing neovasculogenesis and cardiogenesis. In 2003, cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) were first reported to reside in the adult heart <a href="#pone.0069134-Oh1" class="ref-tip">[1]</a>–<a href="#pone.0069134-Urbanek1" class="ref-tip">[3]</a>. Resident CPCs may be particularly suitble for resurrecting dead myocardium because they are endogenous components of the adult heart and appear to be respnsible for the physiological and pathological turnover of cardiac myocytes and other cardiac cells. The heart have several populations of CPCs, which are self-renewing, clonogenic, multi-potent and have the ability to proliferate and differentiate into functional cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, and other kinds of cells <a href="#pone.0069134-Beltrami1" class="ref-tip">[2]</a>, <a href="#pone.0069134-Dawn1" class="ref-tip">[4]</a>–<a href="#pone.0069134-Messina1" class="ref-tip">[6]</a>. Among these CPCs, c-kit(+)CPCs are especially suitable in cell therapy for the recovery of injured cardiomyocytes <a href="#pone.0069134-Beltrami1" class="ref-tip">[2]</a>, <a href="#pone.0069134-Dawn1" class="ref-tip">[4]</a>. c-kit(+)CPCs have the larger numbers than other types of CPCs, and have stronger proliferation and differentiation ability to repair the injured myocardium <a href="#pone.0069134-Linke1" class="ref-tip">[7]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec1.p2" class="link-target"></a><p>c-kit is a proto-oncogene and a tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor, expressed on several types of cells, including CPCs <a href="#pone.0069134-TeyssierLeDiscorde1" class="ref-tip">[8]</a>–<a href="#pone.0069134-Urbanek2" class="ref-tip">[11]</a>, with the stem cell factor (SCF) as its ligand. c-kit expression is related to the regulation of cell proliferation, and migration <a href="#pone.0069134-Kitamura1" class="ref-tip">[12]</a>–<a href="#pone.0069134-Naqvi1" class="ref-tip">[15]</a>. Stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) is a member of the CXC chemokine family, and CXCR4 is its receptor, which are expressed in a variety of cell types, including CPCs <a href="#pone.0069134-Tang1" class="ref-tip">[16]</a>. SDF-1α expression has been reported to increase after an acute myocardial infarction <a href="#pone.0069134-Ma1" class="ref-tip">[17]</a>. SDF-1α/CXCR4 axis could prompt stem cell homing to damaged cardiac tissue <a href="#pone.0069134-Tang1" class="ref-tip">[16]</a>, <a href="#pone.0069134-Mouquet1" class="ref-tip">[18]</a>. AMD3100 is a specific antagonist to SDF-1α, which binds to CXCR4 competitively for preventing the combination of SDF-1α and CXCR4. Recent studies have indicated that SDF-1α/CXCR4 and c-kit/SCF axes are closely linked <a href="#pone.0069134-Cheng2" class="ref-tip">[19]</a>. Our study found that SDF-1α could enhance c-kit expression. However, limited information is known on the regulation of SDF-1α on c-kit.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec1.p3" class="link-target"></a><p>DNA methylation is one of the important research content of epigenetics, which cytosine is methylated in a reaction catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), with S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) as a methyl donor <a href="#pone.0069134-Miranda1" class="ref-tip">[20]</a>. In mammalian cells, three DNMTs, namely, DNMT1, DNMT3α, and DNMT3β, are responsible for DNA methylation. DNMT1 is a maintenance type methyltransferase, responsible for copying DNA methylation patterns during DNA replication, whereas DNMT3α and DNMT3β are essential for de novo methylation <a href="#pone.0069134-Miranda1" class="ref-tip">[20]</a>–<a href="#pone.0069134-Plachot1" class="ref-tip">[25]</a>. DNA methylation is an important method in the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression <a href="#pone.0069134-Miranda1" class="ref-tip">[20]</a>–<a href="#pone.0069134-ZeJunLMasato1" class="ref-tip">[29]</a>. In several diseases such as cancer, gene promoter CpG islands result in abnormal silencing <a href="#pone.0069134-Poplawski1" class="ref-tip">[27]</a>–<a href="#pone.0069134-ZeJunLMasato1" class="ref-tip">[29]</a>. A recent study has found that TGFβ1 could regulate CD133 expression through the inhibition of DNMT1 and DNMT3β expressions, and subsequently, the demethylation of promoter-1 <a href="#pone.0069134-You1" class="ref-tip">[30]</a>. However, the influence of SDF-1α on the expression of c-kit by DNA methylation is unknown.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec1.p4" class="link-target"></a><p>The present study demonstrates that SDF-1α combined with CXCR4 could up-regulate c-kit expression of c-kit(+)CPCs and make c-kit(−)CPCs expressing c-kit, which result in the CPCs proliferation and migration ability improvement, through the inhibition of DNMT1 and DNMT3β expression and global DNMT activity, as well as the subsequent demethylation of the c-kit gene.</p>

<h3>Isolation and culture of CPCs</h3>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" class="link-target"></a><p>For the isolation and culture of CPCs in our laboratory <a href="#pone.0069134-Yan1" class="ref-tip">[31]</a>, CPCs were acquired from the hearts of two-month-old wild-type male C57BL/6 mice (Yangzhou Laboratory Animal Center). The hearts were acquired using a method approved by the Care of Experimental Animals Committee of the Southeast University, Nanjing, China (Laboratory Animal Center of Southeast University). CPCs were isolated following the standard method described previously. After one or two weeks of growth, a layer of fibroblast-like cells were generated from the adherent myocardial tissue. On these fibroblast-like cells, several small, round, and phase-bright cells emerged, which were collected by the digestion of accutase enzyme, which did not affect the cell surface markers (at room temperature, under direct visualization, for a maximum of 3 min). The obtained cells were separated by magnetic-activated c-kit cell sorting magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., GER) following the instructions of the manufacturers. Cells were seeded at 2×104 cells/ml on poly-D-lysine (Sigma, USA) coated dishes in cardiosphere growing medium (CGM; 35% IMDM/65%DMEM-Ham's F-12 [Hyclone, USA] mixture containing 10% fetal calf serum [Hyclone, USA], 2 mmol/L L-glutamine [Hyclone, USA], 0.1 mmol/L 2-mecraptoethanol [Sigma, USA], 2% B27 [Gibco, USA], 5 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) [R&amp;D, USA], 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF) [Peprotech, USA], 40 nmol/L cardiotrophin-1 [Peprotech, USA], 1 unit/ml thrombin [Sigma, USA], 100U/ml penicillinG [Hyclone, USA], and 100 μg/ml streptomycin [Hyclone, USA]).</p>

The results showed that DNMT expression, include DNMT1, DNMT3α, and DNMT3β, was significantly higher in c-kit(−)CPCs compared to c-kit(+)CPCs, and SDF-1α combined with CXCR4 was able to reduce the DNMT1 and DNMT3β expression (<a href="#pone-0069134-g004">Figures 4A, 4B and 4C</a>).

<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p2" name="article1.body1.sec4.p2" class="link-target"></a><p>In regenerating the functional cardiac tissue, stem cell therapy is an effective method for the recovery of the injured myocardium. We selected CPCs because of their incomparable cardiac regenerative capacity <a href="#pone.0069134-Rota1" class="ref-tip">[33]</a>–<a href="#pone.0069134-PadinIruegas1" class="ref-tip">[34]</a>. Presently, CPCs are based exclusively on the expression of a stem cell-related surface antigen, namely, c-kit and Sca-1. CPCs are multipotent, self-renewing, and clonogenic, which have the ability to transform cardiomyocytes in normal, as well as in aging and diseased hearts. CPCs apparently have a mixture of different subpopulations. Among these CPCs, c-kit(+)CPCs showed better cardiac repair capability thus are considered as the most suitable cells for myocardial regeneration therapies <a href="#pone.0069134-Kawaguchi1" class="ref-tip">[35]</a>. Hence, in this study, we selected the marker, c-kit, as the identification index of CPCs, as observed in the heart. Our study verified that, an adequate amount of CPCs could be acquired from an adult mouse heart through enzymatic digestion, c-kit(+)CPCs and c-kit(−)CPCs could be separated by magnetic-activated cell sorting. CPCs within 10 generations, which we had actually examined for c-kit expression, were used for these experiments. Researches showed that c-kit (+)CPCs could be passaged to the 40 generation, and still had kept the stem cell surface markers <a href="#pone.0069134-Miyamoto1" class="ref-tip">[36]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p3" name="article1.body1.sec4.p3" class="link-target"></a><p>c-kit is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase factor receptor. Its ligand, SCF, is an early hemopoietic growth factor. c-kit/SCF axis supports the proliferation and migration of multiple hemopoietic lineages <a href="#pone.0069134-Martin1" class="ref-tip">[37]</a>–<a href="#pone.0069134-Huang1" class="ref-tip">[39]</a>. SDF-1α belongs to the CXC subfamily, which has the ability to facilitate the transmigration of hematopoietic cells through endothelial cell barriers <a href="#pone.0069134-Mhle1" class="ref-tip">[40]</a>. CXCR4 is its receptor, a seven- transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor. SDF-1α expression is aimed to protect against myocardial ischemic injury <a href="#pone.0069134-Kortesidis1" class="ref-tip">[41]</a>, which is critical in progenitor cell tissue retention, trafficking, and homing <a href="#pone.0069134-Kucia1" class="ref-tip">[42]</a>. SDF-1α expression has been shown to enhance the survival of progenitor cells in several stimuli such as in ischemia/reperfusion injury <a href="#pone.0069134-Hu1" class="ref-tip">[43]</a>–<a href="#pone.0069134-Askari1" class="ref-tip">[44]</a>, serum withdrawal and apoptotic cell death, through interaction with CXCR4 <a href="#pone.0069134-Tachibana1" class="ref-tip">[45]</a>. AMD3100 is a specific antagonist to SDF-1α, which competitively binds to CXCR4 to prevent the combination of SDF-1α and CXCR4, effectively blocking&gt;90% of binding SDF-1α <a href="#pone.0069134-Fricker1" class="ref-tip">[46]</a>. A recent study showed that AMD3100 with the concentration of 5 μg/ml could efficiently prevent the SDF-1α/CXCR4 axis <a href="#pone.0069134-Stamatopoulos1" class="ref-tip">[47]</a>. In our study, we found that SDF-1α combined with CXCR4 could up-regulate c-kit expression of c-kit(+)CPCs and make c-kit(−)CPCs expressing c-kit, which result in the CPCs proliferation and migration abilities improvement. Research showed VEGFMSCs could induced SDF-1α and CXCR4 expression, and promoted CSCs proliferation and migration, whereas blockade of SDF-1α or its receptor CXCR4 by RNAi or antagonist significantly diminished these beneficial effects of VEGFMSCs <a href="#pone.0069134-Tang2" class="ref-tip">[48]</a>. Our results were similar to these results, and the conclusion was that SDF-1α/CXCR4 axis could affect CSCs proliferation and migration. However, the mechanism is not quite clear.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p4" name="article1.body1.sec4.p4" class="link-target"></a><p>DNA methylation is an important mechanism for gene transcriptional silencing. CpG hypermethylation in DNA promoter regions is responsible for gene silencing <a href="#pone.0069134-Ikeda1" class="ref-tip">[49]</a>–<a href="#pone.0069134-Sako1" class="ref-tip">[51]</a>. DNA methylation status was regulated by DNMT, which has <em>de novo</em> methylation activity. We found that SDF-1α combined with CXCR4 could inhibit global DNMT activity. Furthermore, DNMT expression, include DNMT1, DNMT3α, and DNMT3β, was significantly higher in c-kit(−)CPCs compared to c-kit(+)CPCs, and DNMT1 and DNMT3β expression was suppressed by the stimulation of SDF-1α combined with CXCR4. Therefore, DNMT1 and DNMT3β are critical enzymes in the mechanism of SDF-1α combined with CXCR4 induced c-kit expression. Meanwhile, Bisulfite sequencing analysis was chosen to quantify the promoter methylation degree in multiple CpG sites. Our data demonstrated that SDF-1α significantly reduces c-kit promoter methylation of c-kit(+)CPCs in five out of seven CpG sites, and all of seven CpG sites for c-kit(−)CPCs. Therefore, the 7th and 15th CpG sites probably play an important role in the expression of c-kit gene in c-kit(−)CPCs. Although the effect of SDF-1α on methylation in individual CpG sites is relatively small, the overall effect of accumulated demethylation induced by SDF-1α in multiple CpG sites has significant influence on c-kit transcription. Therefore, SDF-1α induced demethylation in the c-kit promoter is important in the regulation of c-kit transcription.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.p5" name="article1.body1.sec4.p5" class="link-target"></a><p>Our study demonstrated that SDF-1α combined with CXCR4 could regulate c-kit expression, which result in the CPCs proliferation and migration ability improvement, and this function could be suppressed by ADM3100. Furthermore, the up-regulation of c-kit expression by SDF-1α combined with CXCR4 is through the inhibition of DNMT1 and DNMT3β expression and the global DNMTs activity, as well as through the subsequent demethylation of the c-kit gene. In summary, this study described a mechanism by which SDF-1α combined with CXCR4 regulates c-kit expression through promoter demethylation. However, no clue about the mechanism of the inhibiting effect of SDF-1α combined with CXCR4 to DNMT was found so far. We will continue to search for the possible mechanism. Our current findings provided a novel strategy for stem cell therapy in recovering damaged myocardium through the modification of the status of c-kit promoter methylation by potentially targeting SDF-1α or DNMTs.</p>
