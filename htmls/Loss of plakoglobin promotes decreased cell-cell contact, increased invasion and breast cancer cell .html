        <title>Loss of plakoglobin promotes decreased cell-cell contact, increased invasion, and breast cancer cell dissemination in vivo  | Breast Cancer Research | Full Text</title>

        

    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="The majority of deaths from breast cancer are a result of metastases; however, little is understood about the genetic alterations underlying their onset. Genetic profiling has identified the adhesion molecule plakoglobin as being three-fold reduced in expression in primary breast tumors that have metastasized compared with nonmetastatic tumors. In this study, we demonstrate a functional role for plakoglobin in the shedding of tumor cells from the primary site into the circulation. We investigated the effects of plakoglobin knockdown on breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and invasion in vitro and on tumor growth and intravasation in vivo. MCF7 and T47D cells were stably transfected with miRNA sequences targeting the plakoglobin gene, or scramble vector. Gene and protein expression was monitored by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot. Cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and invasion were measured by cell counting, flow cytometry, and scratch and Boyden Chamber assays. For in vivo experiments, plakoglobin knockdown and control cells were inoculated into mammary fat pads of mice, and tumor growth, shedding of tumor cells into the bloodstream, and evidence of metastatic bone lesions were monitored with caliper measurement, flow cytometry, and microcomputed tomography (&#956;CT), respectively. 
                           Plakoglobin and &#947;-catenin expression were reduced by more than 80% in all knockdown cell lines used but were unaltered after transfection with the scrambled sequence. Reduced plakoglobin resulted in significantly increased in MCF7 and T47D cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, compared with control, with significantly more tumor cells being shed into the bloodstream of mice bearing plakoglobin knockdown tumors. In addition, plakoglobin knockdown cells showed a &gt;250% increase in invasion through basement membrane and exhibited reduced cell-to-cell adhesion compared with control cells. Decreased plakoglobin expression increases the invasive behavior of breast cancer cells. This is the first demonstration of a functional role for plakoglobin/&#947;-catenin in the metastatic process, indicating that this molecule may represent a target for antimetastatic therapies.">

Genetic profiling has identified the adhesion molecule plakoglobin as being three-fold reduced in expression in primary breast tumors that have metastasized compared with nonmetastatic tumors. In this study, we demonstrate a functional role for plakoglobin in the shedding of tumor cells from the primary site into the circulation. Methods We investigated the effects of plakoglobin knockdown on breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and invasion in vitro and on tumor growth and intravasation in vivo. MCF7 and T47D cells were stably transfected with miRNA sequences targeting the plakoglobin gene, or scramble vector. Gene and protein expression was monitored by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot. Cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and invasion were measured by cell counting, flow cytometry, and scratch and Boyden Chamber assays. For in vivo experiments, plakoglobin knockdown and control cells were inoculated into mammary fat pads of mice, and tumor growth, shedding of tumor cells into the bloodstream, and evidence of metastatic bone lesions were monitored with caliper measurement, flow cytometry, and microcomputed tomography (μCT), respectively. Results Plakoglobin and γ-catenin expression were reduced by more than 80% in all knockdown cell lines used but were unaltered after transfection with the scrambled sequence. Reduced plakoglobin resulted in significantly increased in MCF7 and T47D cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, compared with control, with significantly more tumor cells being shed into the bloodstream of mice bearing plakoglobin knockdown tumors. In addition, plakoglobin knockdown cells showed a &gt;250% increase in invasion through basement membrane and exhibited reduced cell-to-cell adhesion compared with control cells. Conclusion Decreased plakoglobin expression increases the invasive behavior of breast cancer cells. This is the first demonstration of a functional role for plakoglobin/γ-catenin in the metastatic process, indicating that this molecule may represent a target for antimetastatic therapies.">

Genetic profiling has identified the adhesion molecule <i>plakoglobin</i> as being three-fold reduced in expression in primary breast tumors that have metastasized compared with nonmetastatic tumors. In this study, we demonstrate a functional role for <i>plakoglobin</i> in the shedding of tumor cells from the primary site into the circulation.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Methods</h3><p>We investigated the effects of <i>plakoglobin</i> knockdown on breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and invasion <i>in vitro</i> and on tumor growth and intravasation <i>in vivo</i>.

Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3201#Fig3">3E</a> shows control MCF7 cells growing as spheroids on agar, demonstrating that these cells were able to form extensive bonds with surrounding cells.

Reducing <i>plakoglobin</i> levels resulted in a complete loss of spheroid formation in MCF7 cells; both 2A-1 and 3C-3 cells grew as monolayers across the surface of the agar, indicating that these cell lines no longer form strong intercellular bonds. Similarly, reducing <i>plakoglobin</i> in T47D cells resulted in decreased cell-cell adhesion, with 2A-4 cells growing in a less-compact spheroid formation than control cells and cells at the edge of the spheroid growing in a monolayer. The reduced cell-cell adhesion after loss of <i>plakoglobin</i> was confirmed by measuring the ability of DiD-labeled control and knockdown cells to adhere to a confluent cell monolayer of the corresponding cell type. Measurement of the percentage of cells binding to a monolayer after 2 hours (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3201#Fig3">3F</a>) showed that 19.23% ± 2.6% of DiD-labeled MCF7 control cells bound to unlabeled control cells, compared with 2.71% ± 0.30% MCF7 2A-1 cells binding to unlabeled 2A-1 cells and 2.54% ± 0.26% 3C-3 cells binding to unlabeled cells. In addition, T47D control cells were significantly more adhesive than T47D 2A-4 cells; 19.01% ± 2.79% of control cells adhered to a monolayer of the same cell type compared with 4.21% ± 1.06% of 2A-4 cells (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.005), demonstrating that reduced expression of <i>plakoglobin</i> significantly reduces cell-cell adhesion.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec18_3000">Effects of <i>plakoglobin</i> expression on tumor cell invasion and migration</h3><p>As invasion of cancer cells into the surrounding tissue and vasculature is an essential step for initiation of metastasis, we next investigated whether altering <i>plakoglobin</i> levels affects invasion through a basement membrane.

These prometastatic changes have been linked with downregulation of the tumor suppressor <i>NM23-H1</i> [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 25" title="Yang SZ, Kohno N, Yokoyama A, Kondo K, Hamada H, Hiwada K: Decreased E-cadherin augments beta-catenin nuclear localization: studies in breast cancer cell lines. &#xA;                           Int J Oncol 2001, 18:541–548." href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3201#ref-CR25_3000" id="ref-link-section-d168897094e1815">25</a>]. In the current study, <i>NM23-H1</i> expression was reduced in T47D 2A-3 and MCF7 2A-1 cells; however, <i>NM23-H1</i> was unaltered in MCF7 3C-3 cells, which were significantly more migratory and invasive than MCF-7 2A-1 cells. Therefore, it appears that although altering intercellular adhesion molecules can downregulate <i>NM23-H1</i>, other interacting factors may be necessary for silencing of this gene. Key events in initiation of metastasis include tumor cell proliferation, detachment of cells from the primary tumor, migration toward the vasculature, and invasion into the blood and lymphatic systems. Knocking down <i>plakoglobin</i> expression substantially increased the prometastatic potential of both cell lines, increasing proliferation, reducing intercellular adhesion, and increasing invasion. Tumor cell migration was also increased in T47D knockdown cells compared with control. Interestingly, alterations in metastatic phenotype were more pronounced in T47D than in MCF7 cells. These observations may be due to the differences in <i>plakoglobin</i> expression between the two cell lines: T47D miRNA knockdown cells express between 19- and 21-fold lower <i>plakoglobin</i> levels compared with control, whereas <i>plakoglobin</i> expression in MCF7-knockdown cells is six- to eightfold lower compared with MCF7 control. MCF7 2A-1 cells that show a sixfold reduction in <i>plakoglobin</i> compared with control are less invasive and migratory than MCF7 3C-3 cells, whose <i>plakoglobin</i> expression is reduced eightfold compared with control. These data strongly indicate that the level of <i>plakoglobin</i> expression within a breast cancer cell specifically correlates with its ability to undergo events involved in escape of tumor cells from the primary site.</p><p>For a metastatic tumor to grow at a distal site, tumor cells must be able to invade the circulatory system, survive in the bloodstream, and home to and colonize a specific metastatic site [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 23" title="Guise TA: Molecular mechanisms of osteolytic bone metastases. &#xA;                           Cancer 2000, 88:2892–2898." href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3201#ref-CR23_3000" id="ref-link-section-d168897094e1852">23</a>, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 28" title="Zetter BR: Adhesion molecules in tumor metastasis. &#xA;                           Semin Cancer Biol 1993, 4:219–229." href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3201#ref-CR28_3000" id="ref-link-section-d168897094e1855">28</a>, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 40" title="Ottewell PD, Coleman RE, Holen I: From genetic abnormality to metastases: murine models of breast cancer and their use in the development of anticancer therapies. &#xA;                           Breast Cancer Res Treat 2006, 96:101–113." href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3201#ref-CR40_3000" id="ref-link-section-d168897094e1858">40</a>]. In accordance with our <i>in vitro</i> findings, <i>plakoglobin-</i>knockdown cells grew significantly faster than control cells when inoculated into the mammary fat pads of balb/c nude mice. In addition, increased numbers of EpCAM-positive tumor cells were isolated from whole blood in mice with MCF7 3C-3 tumors compared with controls, and the cells were viable and able to form colonies when grown in culture. These data indicate a higher degree of tumor cell dissemination into the circulation from mammary tumors with low levels of <i>plakoglobin</i> than from tumors expressing high levels of this gene. Despite high levels of circulating EpCAM-positive cells in mice with MCF7 3C-3 tumors, metastatic tumor growth was not detected in the bones of any animals. This finding may be due to MCF7 cells being unable to undergo the late stages of metastases (bone homing and colonization), although MCF7 cells have previously been used to induce breast cancer growth in bone after intracardiac inoculation [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 41" title="Ottewell PD, Deux B, Mönkkönen H, Cross S, Coleman RE, Clezardin P, Holen I: Differential effect of doxorubicin and zoledronic acid on intraosseous versus extraosseous breast tumor growth in vivo. &#xA;                           Clin Cancer Res 2008, 14:4658–4666." href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3201#ref-CR41_3000" id="ref-link-section-d168897094e1871">41</a>]. The most likely explanation for this finding is that mice used in the current study were 10 to 12 weeks old when tumors were inoculated, and we and others have shown tumors do not take if animals that are older than 8 weeks. It is hypothesized that high bone turnover, as seen in young animals, is critical for human tumor metastasis to mouse bone [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 41" title="Ottewell PD, Deux B, Mönkkönen H, Cross S, Coleman RE, Clezardin P, Holen I: Differential effect of doxorubicin and zoledronic acid on intraosseous versus extraosseous breast tumor growth in vivo. &#xA;                           Clin Cancer Res 2008, 14:4658–4666." href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3201#ref-CR41_3000" id="ref-link-section-d168897094e1874">41</a>, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 42" title="Mundy GR: Mechanisms of bone metastasis. &#xA;                           Cancer 1997, 80:1546–1556." href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3201#ref-CR42_3000" id="ref-link-section-d168897094e1877">42</a>]. We were unable to test this hypothesis in the mammary fat pads of 6-week-old animals, as the fat pads were too small to inoculate. It is also possible that any tumor metastases present in bone were undetectable because of the short period of these experiments (~5 weeks compared with 12 weeks required for metastatic lesions to develop in mouse bones after intracardiac inoculation of MCF7 cells) [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 42" title="Mundy GR: Mechanisms of bone metastasis. &#xA;                           Cancer 1997, 80:1546–1556." href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3201#ref-CR42_3000" id="ref-link-section-d168897094e1880">42</a>]. The effects of <i>plakoglobin</i> expression on tumor cell homing and colonization of distal organs clearly warrant further investigation and will form part of our future research strategy.</p></div></div></section><section data-title="Conclusion"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec22_3000-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec22_3000">Conclusion</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec22_3000-content"><p>In conclusion, this study is the first to show that reduced <i>plakoglobin</i> expression results in translocation of intercellular adhesion proteins e-cadherin and β-catenin from the cell membrane to the nucleus and cytoplasm, as well as increasing cell-cell detachment, invasion, and intravascular dissemination of breast cancer cells. Taken together, our results show that <i>plakoglobin</i> has a functional role in the metastatic process; it may therefore be a suitable prognostic marker for breast cancer metastasis and be considered a potential therapeutic target.</p></div></div></section>
