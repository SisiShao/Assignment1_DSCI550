        <title>Honokiol activates AMP-activated protein kinase in breast cancer cells via an LKB1-dependent pathway and inhibits breast carcinogenesis | Breast Cancer Research | Full Text</title>

        

    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="Honokiol, a small-molecule polyphenol isolated from magnolia species, is widely known for its therapeutic potential as an antiinflammatory, antithrombosis, and antioxidant agent, and more recently, for its protective function in the pathogenesis of carcinogenesis. In the present study, we sought to examine the effectiveness of honokiol in inhibiting migration and invasion of breast cancer cells and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Clonogenicity and three-dimensional colony-formation assays were used to examine breast cancer cell growth with honokiol treatment. The effect of honokiol on invasion and migration of breast cancer cells was evaluated by using Matrigel invasion, scratch-migration, spheroid-migration, and electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS)-based migration assays. Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis were used to examine activation of the liver kinase B1 (LKB1)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) axis. Isogenic LKB1-knockdown breast cancer cell line pairs were developed. Functional importance of AMPK activation and LKB1 overexpression in the biologic effects of honokiol was examined by using AMPK-null and AMPK-wild type (WT) immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and isogenic LKB1-knockdown cell line pairs. Finally, mouse xenografts, immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis of tumors were used. Analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms revealed that honokiol treatment increases AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and activity, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of the downstream target of AMPK, acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) and inhibition of phosphorylation of p70S6kinase (pS6K) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4EBP1). By using AMPK-null and AMPK-WT (MEFs), we found that AMPK is required for honokiol-mediated modulation of pACC-pS6K. Intriguingly, we discovered that honokiol treatment increased the expression and cytoplasmic translocation of tumor-suppressor LKB1 in breast cancer cells. LKB1 knockdown inhibited honokiol-mediated activation of AMPK and, more important, inhibition of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, honokiol treatment resulted in inhibition of breast tumorigenesis in vivo. Analysis of tumors showed significant increases in the levels of cytoplasmic LKB1 and phospho-AMPK in honokiol-treated tumors. Taken together, these data provide the first in vitro and in vivo evidence of the integral role of the LKB1-AMPK axis in honokiol-mediated inhibition of the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. In conclusion, honokiol treatment could potentially be a rational therapeutic strategy for breast carcinoma.">

        <meta property="og:description" content="Introduction Honokiol, a small-molecule polyphenol isolated from magnolia species, is widely known for its therapeutic potential as an antiinflammatory, antithrombosis, and antioxidant agent, and more recently, for its protective function in the pathogenesis of carcinogenesis. In the present study, we sought to examine the effectiveness of honokiol in inhibiting migration and invasion of breast cancer cells and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Methods Clonogenicity and three-dimensional colony-formation assays were used to examine breast cancer cell growth with honokiol treatment. The effect of honokiol on invasion and migration of breast cancer cells was evaluated by using Matrigel invasion, scratch-migration, spheroid-migration, and electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS)-based migration assays. Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis were used to examine activation of the liver kinase B1 (LKB1)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) axis. Isogenic LKB1-knockdown breast cancer cell line pairs were developed. Functional importance of AMPK activation and LKB1 overexpression in the biologic effects of honokiol was examined by using AMPK-null and AMPK-wild type (WT) immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and isogenic LKB1-knockdown cell line pairs. Finally, mouse xenografts, immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis of tumors were used. Results Analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms revealed that honokiol treatment increases AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and activity, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of the downstream target of AMPK, acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) and inhibition of phosphorylation of p70S6kinase (pS6K) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4EBP1). By using AMPK-null and AMPK-WT (MEFs), we found that AMPK is required for honokiol-mediated modulation of pACC-pS6K. Intriguingly, we discovered that honokiol treatment increased the expression and cytoplasmic translocation of tumor-suppressor LKB1 in breast cancer cells. LKB1 knockdown inhibited honokiol-mediated activation of AMPK and, more important, inhibition of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, honokiol treatment resulted in inhibition of breast tumorigenesis in vivo. Analysis of tumors showed significant increases in the levels of cytoplasmic LKB1 and phospho-AMPK in honokiol-treated tumors. Conclusions Taken together, these data provide the first in vitro and in vivo evidence of the integral role of the LKB1-AMPK axis in honokiol-mediated inhibition of the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. In conclusion, honokiol treatment could potentially be a rational therapeutic strategy for breast carcinoma.">

In the present study, we sought to examine the effectiveness of honokiol in inhibiting migration and invasion of breast cancer cells and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Methods</h3><p>Clonogenicity and three-dimensional colony-formation assays were used to examine breast cancer cell growth with honokiol treatment. The effect of honokiol on invasion and migration of breast cancer cells was evaluated by using Matrigel invasion, scratch-migration, spheroid-migration, and electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS)-based migration assays. Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis were used to examine activation of the liver kinase B1 (LKB1)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) axis. Isogenic LKB1-knockdown breast cancer cell line pairs were developed. Functional importance of AMPK activation and LKB1 overexpression in the biologic effects of honokiol was examined by using AMPK-null and AMPK-wild type (WT) immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and isogenic LKB1-knockdown cell line pairs. Finally, mouse xenografts, immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis of tumors were used.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Results</h3><p>Analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms revealed that honokiol treatment increases AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and activity, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of the downstream target of AMPK, acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) and inhibition of phosphorylation of p70S6kinase (pS6K) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4EBP1). By using AMPK-null and AMPK-WT (MEFs), we found that AMPK is required for honokiol-mediated modulation of pACC-pS6K. Intriguingly, we discovered that honokiol treatment increased the expression and cytoplasmic translocation of tumor-suppressor LKB1 in breast cancer cells. LKB1 knockdown inhibited honokiol-mediated activation of AMPK and, more important, inhibition of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, honokiol treatment resulted in inhibition of breast tumorigenesis <i>in vivo</i>. Analysis of tumors showed significant increases in the levels of cytoplasmic LKB1 and phospho-AMPK in honokiol-treated tumors.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Conclusions</h3><p>Taken together, these data provide the first <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> evidence of the integral role of the LKB1-AMPK axis in honokiol-mediated inhibition of the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. In conclusion, honokiol treatment could potentially be a rational therapeutic strategy for breast carcinoma.</p></div></div></section>

About 226,870 new cases of invasive breast cancer and about 63,300 new cases of carcinoma <i>in situ</i> will be diagnosed in 2012, according to the latest estimates for breast cancer in the United States by American Cancer Society. Despite major advances in screening programs and development of various targeted therapeutic approaches, mortality related to breast cancer still remains at a staggering high level, with approximately 1 in 35 women dying of breast cancer. Available therapies, including radiation, endocrine, and conventional chemotherapy, are often limited by high toxicity, lower efficacy, therapeutic resistance, and therapy-related morbidity. Therefore, more-effective therapeutic strategies are clearly needed to combat breast cancer and to reduce morbidity and mortality.</p><p>The importance of active constitutive agents in natural products has become increasingly apparent, owing to their potential cancer preventive as well as therapeutic properties [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Surh YJ: Cancer chemoprevention with dietary phytochemicals.

We examined the effect of honokiol on breast cancer cell migration and invasion by using scratch migration, electric-cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS)-based migration, spheroid migration, and Matrigel invasion assays. Honokiol treatment resulted in inhibition of migration of breast cancer cells (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3128#Fig2">2a</a>) in comparison with untreated cells. For quantitative determination of alteration in the migration potential of breast cancer cells on treatment with honokiol, we performed a quantitative real-time impedance assay by using an ECIS-based technique. As expected, confluent cells showed high resistance values. Confluent cells were subjected to a high-voltage pulse that resulted in decrease in resistance, indicating death and detachment of cells present on the small active electrode. Cells were left untreated or treated with honokiol, and changes in resistance were recorded for 24 hours. Control untreated cells showed an increase in resistance, showing increased migration of cells surrounding the small active electrode that were not submitted to the elevated voltage pulse to reach the resistance values of the nonwounded cells at the start of the experiment. Honokiol-treated cells showed a decrease in resistance, indicating decreased migration. Notably, honokiol-treated cells never reached the values of nonwounded cells, showing significant inhibition of migration potential (Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3128#MOESM2">2</a>). We examined the effect of honokiol treatment on the migratory capacity of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells spheroids. Significant migration of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells from the spheroids was seen under untreated conditions. Honokiol treatment resulted in inhibition of migration of cells from spheroids (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3128#Fig2">2b</a>).

As evident from Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3128#Fig2">2c</a>, honokiol treatment decreased invasion of breast cancer cells through Matrigel in comparison with untreated cells.

We investigated the effect of honokiol on the formation of the LKB1-STRAD complex in breast cancer cells. To address this question, breast cancer cells were treated with honokiol followed by immunoprecipitation with LKB1 antibodies. Immunoprecipitated protein complexes were analyzed for the presence of STRAD by using Western blot analysis. Higher levels of STRAD immunoprecipitated with LKB1 in the presence of honokiol indicated increased formation of the LKB1-STRAD complex (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3128#Fig5">5b</a>).

To address these questions, we used LKB1<sup>shRNA</sup> lentivirus and puromycin to select for stable pools of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells with LKB1 depletion. We analyzed pLKO.1 and LKB1<sup>shRNA</sup> stable MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cell pools for LKB1 protein expression with immunoblot analysis and found that LKB1 protein expression was significantly reduced in LKB1<sup>shRNA</sup> cells (shRNA1 and shRNA2) as compared with pLKO.1 control cells (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3128#Fig5">5d</a>). pLKO.1 and LKB1<sup>shRNA</sup> cells were treated with honokiol, and phosphorylation of AMPK was determined by using Western blot analysis. We found that honokiol increased phosphorylation of AMPK in pLKO.1 cells. Intriguingly, displaying a crucial role of LKB1, honokiol treatment did not change the phosphorylation levels of AMPK in LKB1<sup>shRNA</sup> cells (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3128#Fig5">5e</a>). Invasion and migration are the key biologic features of malignant behavior of carcinoma cells [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 29" title="Steeg PS, Theodorescu D: Metastasis: a therapeutic target for cancer.

In addition to examining the effect of LKB1 depletion on honokiol-induced modulation of AMPK, we also examined the requirement of LKB1 in honokiol-mediated inhibition of metastatic properties of breast cancer cells. As evident from Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3128#Fig5">5f</a>, honokiol treatment efficiently inhibited migration of pLKO.1 cells, whereas untreated pLKO.1 cells showed increased migration. Our results showed that LKB1<sup>shRNA</sup> cells exhibited increased migration in the absence of honokiol treatment. Interestingly, honokiol treatment did not inhibit the migration of LKB1<sup>shRNA</sup> cells (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3128#Fig5">5f</a>). We next examined the effect of honokiol on invasion potential of pLKO.1 and LKB1<sup>shRNA</sup> cells and found that honokiol inhibited invasion of pLKO.1 cells, whereas LKB1<sup>shRNA</sup> cells were not affected by honokiol treatment (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3128#Fig5">5g</a>). These results collectively show that honokiol-induced LKB1 overexpression is indeed a crucial component of the signaling machinery used by honokiol in modulating the AMPK-S6K axis and inhibiting the metastatic properties of breast cancer cells.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec22">Honokiol treatment inhibits breast-tumor progression in athymic nude mice</h3><p>We investigated the physiological relevance of our <i>in vitro</i> findings by evaluating whether honokiol has any suppressive effects on the development of breast carcinoma in nude mouse models and the involvement of the LKB1-AMPK axis. In the experimental group treated with honokiol, the rate of tumor growth was significantly inhibited, and the tumor size and weight were significantly reduced compared with control group (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3128#Fig6">6a, b</a>).

In our <i>in vitro</i> analyses, we discovered the involvement and requirement of the LKB1-AMPK axis in biologic functions of honokiol. We examined the expression of LKB1 and p-AMPK in tumors treated with honokiol. Tumors treated with honokiol displayed higher levels of phosphorylated AMPK and LKB1 (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3128#Fig6">6c</a>). In addition, we examined the expression levels of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated AMPK, ACC as well as S6K, in honokiol-treated and vehicle-treated mice. We found higher levels of phosphorylated AMPK and ACC in honokiol-treated tumors as compared with vehicle-treated controls. Honokiol-treated tumors showed lower levels of phosphorylated S6K, whereas vehicle-treated controls exhibited high levels of phosphorylated S6K (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/bcr3128#Fig6">6d</a>).

Our study shows for the first time that honokiol stimulates the cytosolic translocation of LKB1 in breast cancer cells.</p></div></div></section><section data-title="Conclusions"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec24-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec24">Conclusions</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec24-content"><p>We uncovered a novel mechanism by which honokiol inhibits invasion and migration of breast cancer cells, which involves enhanced expression and cytosolic localization of LKB1 and AMPK activation. We also demonstrated the requirement of LKB1 and AMPK in honokiol-mediated inhibition of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Our results thus provide new insight into the mechanisms by which honokiol, a promising anticancer agent, inhibits breast carcinogenesis.</p></div></div></section><section data-title="Conflicting interests"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec25-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec25">Conflicting interests</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec25-content"><p>AN, MYB, NKS, and DS declare no conflict of interest.
