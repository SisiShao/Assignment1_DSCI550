  <meta name="description" content="The regeneration of tubular epithelial cells (TECs) after acute kidney injury (AKI) is crucial for the recovery of renal structure and function. The mechanism by which quiescent TECs re-obtain a potential to regenerate remains unknown. In this study, we observed a transient re-expression of embryonic gene Paired box 2 (Pax2) in adult rat TECs in vivo during ischemia-reperfusion induced AKI and most Pax2 positive TECs co-expressed kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), a tubular injury marker. The re-expression of Pax2 was accompanied by increased levels of intrarenal Angiotensin II, which is a crucial injury factor of AKI. Furthermore, we also found a temporary re-expression of Pax2 in NRK-52E cells under the stimulation of Angiotensin II. This stimulatory effect could be blocked by PD123319 (Angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) inhibitor) and AG490 (Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitor). As Pax2 is essential for the phenotypic conversion from mesenchymal stem cells to TECs during kidney development, we proposed that the re-expression of Pax2 in mature TECs may be an indicator of &ldquo;atavistic&rdquo; transition which mimics but reverses the processes of development of TECs. This could be proved by that a progenitor marker, CD24, was also found to be transiently expressed shortly after the expression of Pax2 in NRK-52E cells stimulated with Angiotensin II. The expression of CD24 was also suppressed by PD123319 and AG490. Moreover, knockdown of Pax2 by RNA interference could significantly reduce the expression of CD24 in NRK-52E cells stimulated with Angiotension II. Those findings suggest that mature TECs can trans-differentiate into progenitor-like cells by &ldquo;atavistic transition&rdquo;, which may participate in the recovery of tissue structure and Pax2 may play a pivotal role in this process. That might have important implications for further understanding of tubular regeneration after injury." />

The mechanism by which quiescent TECs re-obtain a potential to regenerate remains unknown. In this study, we observed a transient re-expression of embryonic gene Paired box 2 (Pax2) in adult rat TECs in vivo during ischemia-reperfusion induced AKI and most Pax2 positive TECs co-expressed kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), a tubular injury marker. The re-expression of Pax2 was accompanied by increased levels of intrarenal Angiotensin II, which is a crucial injury factor of AKI. Furthermore, we also found a temporary re-expression of Pax2 in NRK-52E cells under the stimulation of Angiotensin II. This stimulatory effect could be blocked by PD123319 (Angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) inhibitor) and AG490 (Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitor). As Pax2 is essential for the phenotypic conversion from mesenchymal stem cells to TECs during kidney development, we proposed that the re-expression of Pax2 in mature TECs may be an indicator of “atavistic” transition which mimics but reverses the processes of development of TECs. This could be proved by that a progenitor marker, CD24, was also found to be transiently expressed shortly after the expression of Pax2 in NRK-52E cells stimulated with Angiotensin II. The expression of CD24 was also suppressed by PD123319 and AG490. Moreover, knockdown of Pax2 by RNA interference could significantly reduce the expression of CD24 in NRK-52E cells stimulated with Angiotension II. Those findings suggest that mature TECs can trans-differentiate into progenitor-like cells by “atavistic transition”, which may participate in the recovery of tissue structure and Pax2 may play a pivotal role in this process. That might have important implications for further understanding of tubular regeneration after injury.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section1" class="section toc-section"><a id="s1" name="s1" data-toc="s1" class="link-target" title="Introduction"></a><h2>Introduction</h2><a id="article1.body1.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec1.p1" class="link-target"></a><p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and severe clinical problem. The recovery of renal function after AKI depends on the recovery of renal tubular epithelium<a href="#pone.0093563-Kusch1" class="ref-tip">[1]</a>, but the mechanism of tubular epithelial reconstruction remains unclear. It has been proposed that surviving tubular epithelial cells (TECs) re-enter cell cycle and replace damaged TECs by proliferating, but the mechanism by which quiescent TECs regain the potential to regenerate is still unknown. Meanwhile, this model has been challenged by recent studies which suggest a role for stem/progenitor cells in kidney repair. Nevertheless, the origin of these stem/progenitor cells remains unclear <a href="#pone.0093563-Maeshima1" class="ref-tip">[2]</a>, <a href="#pone.0093563-Gupta1" class="ref-tip">[3]</a>, <a href="#pone.0093563-Bussolati1" class="ref-tip">[4]</a>, <a href="#pone.0093563-Humphreys1" class="ref-tip">[5]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec1.p2" class="link-target"></a><p>Our previous study demonstrated that TECs could be induced to temporarily re-express embryonic gene Paired box 2 (Pax2) during chronic kidney injury, which indicated that TECs could transform into an immature cell phenotype and participate in kidney repair during chronic kidney injury <a href="#pone.0093563-Huang1" class="ref-tip">[6]</a>. We then proposed that a similar "atavistic" phenotype transition might also occur during AKI <a href="#pone.0093563-Jiang1" class="ref-tip">[7]</a>. This notion is supported by the finding that a mesenchymal cell marker, vimentin, could be expressed in tubular epithelium during the recovery stage of AKI <a href="#pone.0093563-Witzgall1" class="ref-tip">[8]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec1.p3" class="link-target"></a><p>The transition of TECs from one phenotype to another is not a new concept. During the embryonic stage of the kidney, the mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) which mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are converted into a polarized tubular epithelial phenotype is a pivotal event for the differentiation of TECs. Pax2 is expressed during MET and essential for this phenotype transition <a href="#pone.0093563-Torban1" class="ref-tip">[9]</a>. During chronic kidney injury, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been proven to occur in mature TECs. Pax2 is also expressed during EMT and essential for this phenotype transition <a href="#pone.0093563-Huang1" class="ref-tip">[6]</a>. Those findings suggest that the expression of Pax2 controls the phenotype transition between stem/progenitor cells and epithelial cells. Therefore, we believe that the re-expression of Pax2 in mature TECs may be a sign of cell atavistic transition, which mimics but reverses the genetic and cellular processes of tubular development. This atavistic transition allows mature TECs to gain a characteristic of stem/progenitor-like cells, which could re-differentiate into TECs that restore tissue structure.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec1.p4" class="link-target"></a><p>In this study, we demonstrated that Pax2 was re-expressed in TECs during AKI in vivo, and we also found that Pax2 and a stem/progenitor cell marker, CD24, were temporarily re-expressed in NRK-52E cells stimulated with Angiotensin II (Ang II) in vitro. Both AT2R/JAK2 inhibitor and Pax2 iRNA could block the re-expression of Pax2 and CD24 in NRK-52E cells induced by Ang II. These findings led us to propose that mature TECs can undergo an atavistic transition to convert into stem/progenitor-like cells and participate in renal repair during AKI. Pax2 may play a central role in this process.</p>

The heart rate and glucose levels did not statistically differ before, during, or after operation both in experimental groups (IRI groups) and control groups (sham operation groups) (data not shown). The total elimination rate (due to death in all cases) was 5/96 (3/48 for IRI groups and 2/48 for sham operation groups).</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec1.p2" class="link-target"></a><p>The induction of renal damage by IRI was verified by biochemical and histological measurements. Both blood ureanitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) increased significantly during the early stage of AKI in IRI groups (24 to 48 hours (h) after operation). No alteration of BUN and Cr levels was observed in sham operation groups (<a href="#pone-0093563-g001">figure 1</a>).</p>

<h3>Re-expression of Pax2 in proximal tubular epithelium during recovery stage of AKI</h3>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec2.p1" class="link-target"></a><p>The re-expression of Pax2 in the tubular epithelium during AKI was verified via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blot and immunohistochemical (IHC) detections. A remarkable raise of Pax2 mRNA and protein levels was observed in the renal cortex of animals in IRI groups. The expression levels of Pax2 increased at 24 h, maximized at 72 h and decreased at 96 h after IRI. No apparent expression of Pax2 could be observed in sham operated animals (<a href="#pone-0093563-g003">figure 3</a>). The IHC detection showed that Pax2 could not be detected in proximal TECs in normal kidney, while 24-72 h after IRI, Pax2 was expressed in the nuclei of proximal TECs (<a href="#pone-0093563-g004">figure 4</a>). No changes of Pax2 expression pattern was observed in sham operation groups.</p>

Therefore, we used shRNA (pshRNA-Pax2-983)-mediated RNA interference of Pax2 to further determine the relationship between Pax2 and CD24 in NRK-52E cells induced by Ang II.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec2.sec7.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.sec7.p2" class="link-target"></a><p>Transfection of NRK-52E cells with Pax2 shRNA resulted in a significant decrease in Ang II induced Pax2 expression levels as shown by western blot and RT-PCR. The repression rate was 74.3±8.2% as judged by western blot. Transfection with emptily plasmid vector failed to reduce Pax2 expression. The effect of Pax2 shRNA was specific in that it failed to knock down the expression of unrelated protein β-actin (<a href="#pone-0093563-g011">figure 11</a>).</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section3" class="section toc-section"><a id="s3" name="s3" data-toc="s3" class="link-target" title="Discussion"></a><h2>Discussion</h2><a id="article1.body1.sec3.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.p1" class="link-target"></a><p>Pax2 is a transcription control factor which plays a crucial regulatory role during kidney development. During fetal life, Pax2 is essential for the mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET), which mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are converted into tubular epithelial phenotype<a href="#pone.0093563-Torban1" class="ref-tip">[9]</a>. Pax2 is not originally expressed in MSCs, but is only induced when MSCs meet the ureteric bud. Pax-2 controls the process of MET by initiating a genetic cascade that includes WT1, Wnt4, Six2 and c-Ret to suppress the expression of mesenchymal markers, such as vimentin, and promote epithelial markers, such as E-cadherin and cytokeratin <a href="#pone.0093563-Torban2" class="ref-tip">[11]</a>, <a href="#pone.0093563-Torres1" class="ref-tip">[12]</a>, <a href="#pone.0093563-Burrow1" class="ref-tip">[13]</a>. Pax2 is down-regulated once nephrogenesis is complete, showing a transient expression pattern <a href="#pone.0093563-Dressler1" class="ref-tip">[14]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p2" name="article1.body1.sec3.p2" class="link-target"></a><p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and severe clinical problem. The recovery of renal tubular epithelium after AKI is critical for the recovery of renal structure and function. It is still not clear how quiescent TECs regain the potential to regenerate and whether a group of specialized stem/progenitor cells play a role during kidney repair <a href="#pone.0093563-Maeshima1" class="ref-tip">[2]</a>, <a href="#pone.0093563-Gupta1" class="ref-tip">[3]</a>, <a href="#pone.0093563-Bussolati1" class="ref-tip">[4]</a>. Our previous study demonstrated that TECs could be induced to temporarily re-express Pax2 during chronic kidney injury <a href="#pone.0093563-Huang1" class="ref-tip">[6]</a>, which suggested that mature TECs could transform into an immature cell phenotype during chronic kidney injury. We then proposed that a similar atavistic transition might also occur during AKI.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p3" name="article1.body1.sec3.p3" class="link-target"></a><p>In this study, we observed a transient Pax2 re-expression in proximal tubular epithelium of IRI-induced AKI animals. Pax2 was expressed during the recovery stage of AKI. Most Pax2 positive epithelial cells co-expressed a tubular injury marker, KIM-1, indicating that Pax2 was primarily expressed in injured TECs. These data suggest that Pax2 re-expression might have a functional link with kidney epithelium injury and repair.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p4" name="article1.body1.sec3.p4" class="link-target"></a><p>It remains to be shown which factors induce the transient re-expression of Pax2 in TECs after IRI. Intrarenal Angiotensin II (Ang II) is one of the most important injury factors in IRI-induced AKI <a href="#pone.0093563-Efrati1" class="ref-tip">[15]</a>, <a href="#pone.0093563-Wolf1" class="ref-tip">[16]</a>. We verified a dramatic increase of intrarenal Ang II after IRI by RIA. Ang II plays an important role during tubular development and up-regulates Pax2 expression in fetal kidney epithelial cells <a href="#pone.0093563-Wolf2" class="ref-tip">[17]</a>, <a href="#pone.0093563-Zhang1" class="ref-tip">[18]</a>. Thus, we hypothesized that Ang II might also stimulate the re-expression of Pax2 in mature TECs. We then used Ang II to simulate NRK-52E cells in vitro and verified that Ang II could stimulate Pax2 expression in mature TECs in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The expression of Pax2 in NRK-52Es also showed a transient pattern, which is consistent with the transient expression feature during tubular development.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p5" name="article1.body1.sec3.p5" class="link-target"></a><p>During embryonic stage, the stimulatory effect of Ang II on Pax2 is mediated by AT2R. Pax2 and AT2R share a similar transient expression pattern during renal development, both of them are down-regulated in TECs when nephrogenesis is completed <a href="#pone.0093563-Wolf2" class="ref-tip">[17]</a>, <a href="#pone.0093563-Lasaitiene1" class="ref-tip">[19]</a>, <a href="#pone.0093563-Shanmugam1" class="ref-tip">[20]</a>. Interestingly, AT2R is also up-regulated in TECs after kidney injury <a href="#pone.0093563-Cao1" class="ref-tip">[21]</a>, <a href="#pone.0093563-Zhu1" class="ref-tip">[22]</a>. In fetal kidney epithelial cells, AT2R activates Pax2 via JAK2 pathway <a href="#pone.0093563-Zhang1" class="ref-tip">[18]</a>. Therefore, we pre-incubated NRK-52E cells before Ang II administration with PD123319 (AT2R inhibitor) and AG490 (JAK2 inhibitor) to investigate signaling mechanisms that mediate Ang II induced Pax2 expression in NRK-52E cells. We found that both AT2R inhibitor and JAK2 inhibitor could block Ang II induced Pax2 expression in NRK-52E cells, indicating that the stimulatory effect of Ang II on Pax2 expression in mature TECs is mediated by AT2R-JAK2 pathway.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p6" name="article1.body1.sec3.p6" class="link-target"></a><p>Renal Pax2 is down-regulated once nephrogenesis is complete and is not normally expressed in mature TECs. We believe that the re-expression of Pax2 in TECs is an initiating event of cell atavistic transition, which mimics but reverses the genetic and cellular processes of tubular development. This process could allow mature TECs to re-gain the characteristics of stem/progenitor cells. We provided evidence for this hypothesis by the observation that a progenitor marker, CD24 <a href="#pone.0093563-Batchelder1" class="ref-tip">[10]</a>,was transiently expressed in Ang II induced NRK-52E cells shortly after the expression of Pax2. This model could also be supported by a previous study which showed that a mesenchymal cell marker, vimentin, was expressed in the tubular epithelium during the recovery stage of AKI<a href="#pone.0093563-Witzgall1" class="ref-tip">[8]</a>.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p7" name="article1.body1.sec3.p7" class="link-target"></a><p>Moreover, we found that both AT2R inhibitor (PD123319) and JAK2 inhibitor (AG490) which could not only block Ang II induced Pax2 expression, but CD24 expression as well in NRK-52E cells. This result indicaed a regulative role of Pax2 on CD24 expression. We then used shRNA-mediated RNA interference of Pax2 to further determine the relationship between Pax2 and CD24 in NRK-52E cells induced by Ang II. We found that knockdown of Pax2 expression resulted in an apparent suppress of Ang II induced CD24 expression in NRK-52E cells. These data demonstrate that CD24 is regulated by Pax2 in NRK-52E cells stimulated with Ang II.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec3.p8" name="article1.body1.sec3.p8" class="link-target"></a><p>In summary, our findings demonstrated that mature TECs can undergo an atavistic transition under the induction of acute injury factors such as Ang II. This atavistic transition allows mature TECs to re-gain the characteristics of stem/progenitor cells, which could re-differentiate into TECs to restore tissue structure. Pax2 might play a central part in this process. Currently, exogenous stem cells used for AKI treatment are difficult to obtain and extremely expensive. It is very likely that enhancing the atavistic transition of surviving TECs could be more effective than injecting exogenous stem cells. That might have important implications for further understanding of AKI treatment.</p>

<h3>Animals and experimental model of AKI</h3>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p1" class="link-target"></a><p>The animal experiment was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. All animal experimental studies were conducted in accordance with the National Guidelines of Laboratory Animal use and Care in China. Male Wistar rats weighing 250 g to 300 g were obtained from the Experiment Animal Center of Sun Yat-sen University. Animals were maintained at a controlled temperature of 22±2°C with a 12 to 12 h light/dark cycle, with free access to food and water.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p2" class="link-target"></a><p>Animals were randomly divided into 12 groups of 6 animals per group. 6 groups received IRI operation and 6 groups received sham operation without IRI induction.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p3" class="link-target"></a><p>The rats were fasted overnight prior to the operation and anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 10% freshly prepared chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg). Renal ischemia was induced by clamping both renal arteries with microserrefines. The clamps were removed after 45 min to re-establish blood flow in order to mimic the reperfusion injury. Sham operation groups received surgery without IRI induction. The body temperature was monitored with a rectal probe and maintained at 37°C during the entire procedure by surrounding the animals with 37°C water bags. The blood glucose levels and heart rate were measured before, during, and after the operation. After surgery, the incisions were sutured and rats were maintained in separated cages with free access to food and water.</p>
<a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec1.p4" class="link-target"></a><p>Each group of rats was anesthetized with chloral hydrate at 0,24, 48, 72, 96, 120 h after operation. Blood samples were obtained by aspiration from abdominal vein. Blood ureanitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels were measured by a HITACHI 7170A Analyzer (HITACHI). The kidneys were removed and the renal cortex parts were separated for the subsequent experiments. The animals were then sacrificed by injecting overdose of chloral hydrate and potassium chloride.</p>

All cells were cultured in complete medium for 24 h after 4 h of transfection. Cells were then synchronized in serum-free medium fot 12 h. After that, cells in groups B, C and D were treated with 10<sup>−9</sup> mol/L of Ang II and cells in group A were treated with serum-free medium alone. Cells were harvested at different time points for further experiments (1 h for RT-PCR of Pax2, 2 h for western blot of Pax2, 4 h for RT-PCR and western blot of CD24).</p>
